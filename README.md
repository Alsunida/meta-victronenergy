Recipes for software provided by Victron Energy / altered for Victron Energy
product for a dedicated board (U-boot / kernel for example). It should not
contain bbappends, alternative version for well known recipes, those go
to meta-victronenergy-overlay. The intention is that this layer can be added
to an existing oe setup without introducing new version of existing recipes,
but just adding new ones. 

NOTE: don't but recipes in this meta for projects which source code is not 
(fully) publicly available!
